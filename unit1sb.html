                    A = (Q, ∑, δ, q0, F) where<br>
                    • Q is a finite set of states<br>
                    • ∑ is the finite set of input symbols<br>

                <p class="answer">DFA must emit one and only one vertex/line/edge for
                    each element of the alphabet. NFA do not have to
                    obey this and can have multiple edges labeled with
                    the same letter (repetition) and /or edges labeled with
                    the empty string.
                    Both DFA and NFA recognize the same languages –
                    the regular languages.</p>

                    machine—is a finite state machine that accepts/rejects
                    finite strings of symbols and only produces a unique

                    (NFA), or nondeterministic finite state machine, is a finite
                    state machine that (1) does not require input symbols for
                    state transitions and (2) is capable of transitioning to zero

                    machine used to recognize patterns within input
                    taken from some character set (or alphabet) C. The
                    job of an FA is to accept or reject an input depending
