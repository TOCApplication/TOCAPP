                    regular.</p>
                <p class="answer">Complement of L1 is constructed from L1 by reversing the states and

            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">
                <h2>Question 4</h2>
                <p class="question-text">Is the set of strings over the alphabet {0} of the form 0n where n 
                    is not a prime is regular? Prove or disprove.</p>
                <p class="answer">To prove this language is not regular, examine the complement 
                    because the set of regular languages is closed under complement.
                    Assume that the set is regular. Let p be the pumping length of the 
                    language. Then, according to the pumping lemma, break the string 
                    s=0p
                    into s=xyz where y has positive length.
                    Then, s=xyi
                    z=0p+(i-1)|y| must also be in the set for any i. In particular 
                    let i=p+1.Then xyp+1z=0p+p|y| must be in the set so p+p|y| = p(1+|y|) 
                    must be prime.
                    Thus we have a contradiction and the set cannot be regular.</p>

                    Complement of L=∑* - L<br>

                <p class="answer">A regular expression (abbreviated regex or regexp) is a sequence of 
                    characters that forms a search pattern, mainly for use in pattern

                <p class="answer">No, any language accepted by DFA, NFA, ε-NFA is called a regular language. For any finite automaton we can construct an equivalent regular expression and the language represented by regular expressions is a regular language.</p>

                <p class="answer"> 1. Pumping lemma is used for deciding whether or not the given language is regular.<br>

                    2. It is also useful for determing whether L is accepted by a regular expression or not.<br>
                    
                    Example 1:<br>

                    Example 2:<br>
                    
                    All these languages are non-regular languages and this can be proved by pumping lemma.</p>
