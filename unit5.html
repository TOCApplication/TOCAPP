                <h2>Question 1</h2>
                <p class="question-text">When we say a problem is decidable? Give an example of undecidable problem?</p>
                <p class="answer">problem whose language is recursive is said to be decidable. Otherwise the problem is undecidable . i.e there is no algorithm that takes as input an instance of the problem and determines whether the answer to that instance is yes or no.
                    Eg. Halting problem

                <p class="question-text">Mention the difference between P and NP problems?</p>
                <p class="answer">P consists of all those languages or problems accepted by some TM that runs in some polynomial amount of time, as a function of its input length. 
                    NP is the class of languages or problems that are accepted by some nondeterministic TM‟s with a polynomial bound on time taken along any sequence of nondeterministic choices.

                </p>
                <p class="answer">Introduce a modified PCP and reduce the same to the original PCP.
                    Again reduce Lu to the modified PCP.
                    The chain of reduction infers if original Lu is known to be undecidable then conclude that PCP is undecidable.

                <h2>Question 4</h2>
                <p class="question-text">Show that any PSPACE-hard language is also NP-hard?</p>
                <p class="answer">First we must show that the language is not in NP. This is trivial since NP is a subset of PSPACE and therefore, anything outside of PSPACE is also outside of NP.
                    Then we must show that any problem in NP can be reduced to any PSPACE-hard language. Thus, any PSPACE-hard problem is also NP-hard.

                    A property is trivial if it is either empty such that it is satisfied by no language or is all RE languages, or else it is non-trivial.

                <p class="answer">L1 and L2 are recusive language. Then there exists a machine M1 that accepts L1 as well as machine M2 that accepts L2. We can simulate a machine M that accepts the language L such that L = L1 U L2. Then construct M which accepts if M1 accepts. If M1 does not accept then M2 simulates M. That means if M2 accepts then M accepts, if M2 rejects M also rejects. Thus M accepts the language L = L1 U L2 which is recursive.</p>
